# Vue 3.3 - HeadlessUI + TypeScript Generics!

This repo is to demonstrate how to create reusable Vue components using [HeadlessUI](https://headlessui.com/), while also demonstrating the power of TypeScript generics, which are coming to Vue in v3.3.0!

If you have come here from my [blog post](https://maylor.io/blogs/vue-type-generics), you can find the starter code in the `starter` branch. You can find the completed code in the `blog-final` branch. 

The `master` branch contains more HeadlessUI components and a more fleshed out set of abstractions and styling. Please reach out if any issues or comments.
